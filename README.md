# Movie Cards Library

Hey there!

On this project, I was able to:

- Create React Components;
- Manipulate Props;
- Use PropTypes;
- Manipulate CSS;

The Movie Cards Library it's my first React App, and it allowed me to learn about Components, Props and PropTypes, and have some time understanding the framework dynamic.
